# Financial Development and Economic Growth in India: A Multivariate VAR Approach  

This project explores the **causal relationship between financial development and economic growth in India (1974â€“2018)** using a multivariate Vector Autoregression (VAR) framework. The analysis evaluates whether financial sector development drives growth, growth drives financial development, or whether the relationship is bidirectional.  

ðŸ“Š **Type:** Academic Econometrics Project  
ðŸ›  **Methods:** VAR, Johansen Cointegration, Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), Granger Causality  

---

## Research Objectives  
- Examine the short and long term causal linkages between **financial development** and **economic growth**  
- Test the validity of the **supply leading** vs **demand following** hypotheses in the Indian context  
- Identify whether the relationship is unidirectional or bidirectional

## Data  
- **Period:** 1974â€“2018 (annual data)  
- **Sources:** World Bank, FRED Database  
- **Key Variables:**  
  - GDP (economic growth)  
  - Net Incurrence of Liabilities (% of GDP)  
  - Deposit Money Bank Assets (% of GDP)  
  - Private Sector Credit by Banks (% of GDP)  
  - Government Expenditure (% of GDP)

## Methodology  
1. **Stationarity Tests** â€“ Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) to check unit roots  
2. **Johansen Cointegration** â€“ to test for long run relationships among variables  
3. **VECM (Vector Error Correction Model)** â€“ to capture both long- and short run dynamics  
4. **Granger Causality Tests** â€“ to determine direction of causality  

---

## Key Findings  
- Evidence of **long-run cointegration** between financial development and GDP  
- Bidirectional causality observed, supporting the idea that **finance and growth reinforce each other**  
- In the short run, specific indicators (e.g., liabilities, private sector credit) showed causal effects on growth, though not uniformly across all variables

## Tools  
- R / Stata / Python (econometric analysis)  
- Libraries: statsmodels, pandas, numpy, matplotlib (if replicated in Python)
